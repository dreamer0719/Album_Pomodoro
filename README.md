## Upcoming Features
- **Custom Pomodoro Timer**: Divide time into *25 minutes* of work with a *5 minutes break* (short break). After 4 Pomodoros, there will be a *15-minute break* (long break). These work and breaks can be customized based on your preferences!
- **Cute Fur Friends**: Contains cute drawings of the animals that your choice. These furry friends have multiple statuses that you can choose or will be randomized after a specific time (such as chilling, eating, sleeping, playing!). 
- **Task/TO-DO List**: Add and organize tasks that you need to get done for the day! This task can have a deadline, tags (subjects, etc.), notes, direction, etc. These lists could also be synced to the *TO-DO List Management* (another application made by me).
- **Reward system**: You could set rewards after a specific amount of time (like a snack, episodes, etc.). This will trick your brain to produce dopamine, helping you feel relaxing when study/working. 
- **Time Tracker**: Record the total times you are in and the number of Pomodoros.
- **Music**: Contain multiple genres of music playlists that help you to focus and relax :D
